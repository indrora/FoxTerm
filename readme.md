FoxTerm
=======

FoxTerm is a light terminal for Linux. I wanted a terminal that 
has support for the new Unity/OverlayScrollbars in Ubuntu and friends.

Things we dont have
-------------------

there is no configuration at all. Your shell is used, your monospace
font is used and nothing else.

There is no copy/paste except X middle-click copy/paste. 

The default colors are black on white. Dont like it? Mod the code.

Want configuration? Mod the code.

Want features? Add them!



Dependancies
------------
FoxTerm depends on a few deps:

  * vte-sharp
  * gnome-sharp
  * gtk-sharp
  * Mono.Posix
  * gconf-sharp

If you find this untrue, please tell me!

thanks.
